 * To view the demo scene, go into scenes and double click on "A2Scene".
 * This asset pack contains everything necessary to complete the assignment. 
 * The points can be scaled and the line width can also be altered for 
 * various uses (terrain outline, ballon outline, etc). 
 * You may also use Unity primitives such as cubes, spheres and others 
 * but they cannot perform physics calculations for you. 
 * If you feel like there is something missing in the pack, feel free 
 * to contact the TAs.
